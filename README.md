# DNA-Sequence-Classifier

This repository contains an example of applying machine learning to biosciences. This DNA sequence classifier can predict the family of a gene based on their sequence.
The script uses the principle of k-mers to extract features from sequences and processing them before feeding it to the algorithm. 
A sequence classifier can be useful to fully understand the effects of mutations in a certain gene by discovering its function and the protein encoded by that 
gene.
